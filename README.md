# Resumary: A Mobile App for Building Resumes

This is an application developed in Java using Android Studio designed to help users build an outstanding resume. 
High school and college students are the initial intended users, but the potential users include people of all ages.
Resumary allows users to keep a record of their activities and achievements during career development by providing a convenient way to add items into a personal database and categorize them.
The application uses Room API and a SQL database to store and update data live. 
The database is stored locally and is updated anytime the user creates, edits, or deletes an entry. 
Continuous improvements such as more advanced searching and categorization of data and integration with cloud and emails are being considered.
